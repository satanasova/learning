1. write a function that accepts an array and outputs which is most frequent item in the array. If there is no item that occurs more than once, it should return "None"

2. write a function that removes duplicate elements from array.

3. write a function that accepts 2 arrays and displays the difference between them (all the elements that exist in one array and don't exist in the other)

4. write a function that accepts an array of objects ({name:'...', age: ..., gender: '...'}) and accepts a {property name} and sorts the objects in the array based on the property that    was passed as a second argument (example: ([{.}, {.}, {.}], 'name')  - means sort the object by name)

5. write a function that accepts an array of objects ({name:'...', age: ..., gender: '...'}), {property name}, {value}, filters the objects and leaves only those objects that have         property {property name } with value {value}

6. write a function that accepts an array of numbers and checks if there are 2 different pairs of numbers which sum is equal

7. write a function that accepts an array of elements and outputs which is the longest streak of equal elements, how long the streak is and what element is
  example: [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2] - longest streak is [3, 3, 3] starting from index 2

8. write a function that accepts two arrays and merges them. To merge them the function gets all the unique values from the 2 arrays. If an elements exists in the two arrays it is only    included once in the merged array.

9. write a function that accepts an {array of numbers}, {index}, {steps}. It then move the element at position {index} in the array {steps} steps to the right. If the element gets to the end of the array before all the steps are finished, the element is moved to the beginning of the array and continues its steps
